\section{Introduction}
Anthropological research has its foundations in ethnography and participant observation. This includes lengthy fieldwork in a particular community, forming interpersonal relationships and illuminating areas of cultural significance. This process is inductive, iterative and has strong ethical considerations. My field is in the anthropology of food with a keen focus on local food industries and culinary processes, knowledge transmission and glocalised practices. My thesis will be oriented on the Greek island of Lipsi, a small southeastern island in the Dodecanese region consisting of a population of 700. 
\section{Jobs}

- I need to manage my literature, bibliography and references

- I need to create a generalized set of interview questions

- I need to complete the ethics application

- I need to develop a research time line for time management

- I need to begin correspondence with participants on the island

- I need to enhance my skills in the Greek language

\section{Pains}

- It is an long-winded process to compile and organize literature and references 

- Creating generalized questions almost always need to be changed and specified once in the field

- The ethics application is a lengthy and tedious process that needs a lot of attention

- Backing up and storing files are not a strong point of mine

- Laptop has previously ran out of memory, therefore backing up files in another application or hard drive would be useful

- Formatting all the content of the thesis document 

- Writing and organizing four months of field notes on a daily basis

- Not knowing the language and transcribing interviews that need translation

\section{Pain Relievers}

- Finding an application (like endnote) that assists in compiling literature

- Finding a backup and storing application that is reliable and assists with minimizing memory usage on laptop

- Finding a formatting program that I find effective and easily managed

- Finding a note-writing system that compiles and organizes my daily field notes

- Finding an application that automatically transcribes and translates interviews from Greek to English

\section{Gains}

- It would be great to have a time-saving tool that compiles literature so I could easily access specific readings

- It would be helpful to have all my references automated and oragnised

- It would be great to have all my files backed up to ease any worries about data loss

- It would be helpful to alleviate data storage on my computer to ease its memory and avoid overloading

- It would be great to have a formatting program that organizes my thesis in an aesthetically pleasing and coherent manner

- It would be useful to have an automated system that transfers my field notes into an organized format

- It would be helpful to have an automated translating and transcribing system 

\section{Gain Creators}

- I would like a tool that automatically organizes, sorts and stores my literature and references.

- I would like a tool that stores all my files in an organized manner and backs up my storage outside from my laptop memory

- I would like a tool that professionally, aesthetically and coherently formats my thesis

- I would like a tool that organizes my daily field notes into chronological sections with accuracy and detail

- I would like a tool that could transcribe recordings from Greek to English in an interview format
